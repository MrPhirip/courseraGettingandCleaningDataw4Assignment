# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment

The data used was the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset". The following are descriptions of the variable/features from the description of this dataset.


##Code Book
The following variables are in the output dataset "SamsungDataSummary.txt"

|detailedactivity          |Name of activity performed by subject |
|subject                   |Subject number, 1 of the 30 volunteers|

The following are signals where -'XYZ is used to denote 3 -axial signals in the X,Y and Z directions. With mean() and std() giving the mean and standard deviation of these signals respectively.

The following is a description of how these signals are derived from the original source.
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()
fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()
fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()

##How to script
The following guide is an additional reference to the steps indicated in the comments of the script
1. Get required packages (dplyr)
2. create a folder in the working directory and download and unzip the data in that location
3. Load in data from the testing and training folders
4. Combine the data and include header information
5. Exclude any columns which are not mean or standard deviation measurements, keeping the subject column.
6. Join the activity names into the dataframe
7. Use dplyr functions to group the data by activity and subject
8. Use dplyr functions to summarise the data
9. Output the data in a file "SamsungDataSummary.txt" in the Outputs folder
